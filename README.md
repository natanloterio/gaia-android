# Reference Architecture: Bara

This repository serves as a **reference architecture** for building scalable, maintainable, and robust applications. It is intended to be used as a starting point or guide for structuring your own projects, following best practices in code organization, modularization, and configuration management.

## Purpose
- **Demonstrate recommended project structure**
- **Showcase best practices** for build configuration, dependency management, and modularization
- **Provide a foundation** for new projects to ensure consistency and maintainability

## Usage

- Use this repository as a template or reference when starting new projects.
- Adapt the structure, configuration, and code samples to fit your specific requirements.

## Structure Overview
- `app/` - Main application module
- `build-logic/` - Custom Gradle build logic and conventions
- `gradle/` - Gradle configuration files
- `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts` - Project-level build configuration
